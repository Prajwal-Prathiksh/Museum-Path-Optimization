## Description
Contains code meant to optimize the route for a tourist visiting the Louvre Museum, such that the satisfaction level is maximised by visiting all/select exhibits in a single working day. 

This repository represents the work done as part of the course project for AE - 755: Optimization for Engineering Design *(Spring 2020)*, [Prof. Abhijit Gogulapati](https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/people/faculty/abhijit), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
